  <h5>How your score is calculated</h5>
  <p>Your mark is generated by finding how many similarities exist between your textual solution against every other textual solution previously submitted for this specific coursework.</p>

  <br>

  <h5>Understanding your mark</h5>
  <p>The higher your mark is, the more likely it is that you have plagiarised your work.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A mark below <b>15%</b> means that your work is <b>most likely not plagiarised.</b></li>
    <li>A mark between <b>15%</b> and <b>35%</b> means that your work is <b>likely to include some plagiarised content.</b></li>
    <li>A mark above <b>35%</b> means that your work is <b>likely to include a large portion of plagiarised content.</b></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Accordingly, it is likely that your work includes
